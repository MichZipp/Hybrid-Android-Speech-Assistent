# Speech-Triggered-Mobility-Support-And-Privacy

This project shows a Prototyp of an speech assistant who supports privacy and mobility support. 
Fine grained privacy rules were developed to protect the privacy of an user. 
The user can decide which personal information he would like to make public to use with an application.
If the user don't want to share his personal information, the user is able to create a virtual profile.
Also, the app provides fine grained settings for location and the calendar of the user.

The following technologies were used:
- Backend: Node.js with LoopBack
- App: Android with Hotword Detection (Snowboy) 
- SpeechService: AWS Lex with AWS Lambda for the Cloud Logic  

The Prototyp was developed as part of a project at Furtwangen University!
